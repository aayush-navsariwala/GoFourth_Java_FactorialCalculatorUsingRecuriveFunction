# 📐 Factorial Calculator (Java - Recursive)

This is a simple Java console application that calculates the **factorial of a non-negative integer** using a **recursive function**. It also includes full input validation to handle letters, symbols and negative numbers gracefully.

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ Recursive factorial computation
- ✅ Input validation for:
- ✅ Non-integer values (e.g., letters, symbols)
- ✅ Negative integers
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ Continuous prompt until valid input is received

## 📌 What is a Factorial?

The **factorial** of a number `n` (written as `n!`) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.  
- Example: `5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120`
- By definition, `0! = 1`

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a non-negative integer.
2. If the input is invalid, the user is prompted again.
3. Once a valid number is entered, the program calculates the factorial using a recursive method.
4. The result is printed to the console.
